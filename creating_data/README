This folder contains:

The files to create the database and the created database.

In order to create the database one needs to use the data provided in the other input folder. 
Furthermore, the files need to be run in a specific
order: first the EES positions and then the party positions. 
This creates the master_file, used for the descriptive, NL, and analysis chapter.
The file for the RDD is created in the analysis file.
