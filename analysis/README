The folder contains the r code for the analysis. 
Both the files with the functions as well as the actual the files for the actual analysis are included. 

All files run independently. 

The files included are:

  - analysis_des (for chapter 4)
  - analysis_dyad (dyad ratios in chapter 4)
  - analysis_nl (the analysis for the Dutch, chapter 7)
  - analysis_bs (for the oberservational chapter, 5)
  - analysis_rdd (for the RDD, chapter 6)
  - rrp_rdd_functions_vme (the functions for the RDD. Copied from Chadi \& Krause 2018).
  - stimson (the functions for the Dyad ratios, from James Stimson's website). 


Besides the dyad ratios, for chapters 4, 5, and 7 the master_file is all that is needed because the CMP data is loaded via a package. 
For chapter 6, rrp_rdd.tab is also required.
